		Phases). The "Line Voltage" used in the calculation is not the measured voltage, but the set voltage for the area (hence, 230 of
		110 volt). The "Number of Phases" is the numberPhases from the ChargingSchedulePeriod.
		It is usually more convenient to use this for DC charging.
		Note that if numberPhases in a ChargingSchedulePeriod is absent, 3 SHALL be assumed.
